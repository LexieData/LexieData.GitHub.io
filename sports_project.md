# Points, Assists, Rebounds, Oh My!

## Introduction
Let's just say, I am not a sports fan. The closest I've gotten to sports was playing in marching bands and basketball pep bands. So I had to brush up on my sports terminology. In order to practice more Tableau skills, I was assigned a sports project, specifically about basketball.

What I learned from this project was:
  1. Center position is the most effective at making 3 pointers.
  2. The more assists, the more points scored. Center has made more rebounds.
  3. How to show the total points of each team and each player.
  4. Point guard has the highest number of assists.


## The Data
The data from this project comes from a <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2022_totals.html">website</a> called "Basketball Reference." On there, they have the NBA players' stats. The data I used comes from 2022. This data contains 812 rows and 31 columns, where each row represents a player and the columns contain information like position, team name, player name, and stats like 3 point percentage.

## Analysis

I answered 4 questions related to professional basketball:
  1. What position is the most efficient at shooting 3-pointers for every team?
  2. How did different players/positions do on total points, total assists, & total rebounds?
  3. Show the total points scored by each team; that also shows how players on that team scored.
  4. What players had the most assists in every position?

### Question 1
The first question asks: what position is the most efficient at shooting 3-pointers for every team? I showed this by creating a heat map.

This heat map shows the average percentage of 3 pointers for each team and each player's position on that team. The darker the color, the higher the percentage. I couldn't show all of the data here but I concluded that Center position has higher percentages with an outlier of "0" for UTA. 

### Question 2
How did different players/positions do on total points, total assists, & total rebounds? I answered this by creating a bubble plot to show the three different criteria: <br>

Total Assists is on the y axis, Total Points is on the x axis, and Total Rebounds are indicated by the size of the "bubble" for each plot point. Also, here is what the colors represent: Blue represents Center position, orange is Power Forward, green is Point Guard, brown is Small Forward, and purple is Shooting Guard.

This bubble plot shows the more assists made, the more points scored. Players like jsdf Also, more point guards 

### Question 3
Question three wanted me to show the total points scored by each team and that also shows how players on that team scored. I answered this by using a stacked bar chart:
