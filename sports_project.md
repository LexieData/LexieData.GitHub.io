## Points, Assists, Rebounds, Oh My!

### Introduction
Let's just say, I am not a sports fan. The closest I got to sports was playing in marching band and basketball pep bands. In order to practice more Tableau skills, I was assigned a sports project, specifically about basketball.


### The Data
The data from this project comes from a webiste called "Basketball Reference." On there, they have the NBA plays stats. 

### Analysis

I answered 3 questions related to professional basketball:
  1. What position is the most efficient at shooting 3-pointers for every team?
  2. How did different players/positions do on total points, total assists, & total rebounds?

Question 1
The question is: what position is the most efficient at shooting 3-pointers for every team? I showed this by creating a heat map.
()
This heat map shows the average percentage of 3 pointers for each team and each player's position on that team. The darker the color, the higher the percentage.
