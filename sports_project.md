### The Data

### Analysis

I answered 3 questions related to professional basketball:
  1. What position is the most efficient at shooting 3-pointers for every team?
  2. How did different players/positions do on total points, total assists, & total rebounds?

Question 1
The question is: what position is the most efficient at shooting 3-pointers for every team? I showed this by creating a heat map.
()
This heat map shows the average percentage of 3 pointers for each team and each player's position on that team. The darker the color, the higher the percentage.
