# Points, Assists, Rebounds, Oh My!

## Introduction
Let's just say, I am not a sports fan. The closest I've gotten to sports was playing in marching bands and basketball pep bands. In order to practice more Tableau skills, I was assigned a sports project, specifically about basketball.

What I learned from this project was:
  1. Center position is the most effective at making 3 pointers.
  2. The more assists, the more points scored. Center has made more rebounds.
  3. How to show the total points of each team and each player.
  4. Point guard has the highest number of assists.


## The Data
The data from this project comes from a <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2022_totals.html">website</a>. called "Basketball Reference." On there, they have the NBA players' stats. The data I used comes from 2022. 

## Analysis

I answered 3 questions related to professional basketball:
  1. What position is the most efficient at shooting 3-pointers for every team?
  2. How did different players/positions do on total points, total assists, & total rebounds?

### Question 1
The question is: what position is the most efficient at shooting 3-pointers for every team? I showed this by creating a heat map.

This heat map shows the average percentage of 3 pointers for each team and each player's position on that team. The darker the color, the higher the percentage. Center position has higher percentages with an outlier of "0" for UTA. 

### Question 2
How did different players/positions do on total points, total assists, & total rebounds? I answered this by creating a bubble plot to show the three different criteria: <br>

Total Assists is on the y axis, Total Points is on the x axis, and Total Rebounds are indicated by the size of the "bubble" for each plot point.
