# Metals R' Us

## Introduction


What I learned from this project was:
  1. You can see summary statistics in Python by coding **df.describe()**
  2. 


## The Data
The data from this project comes from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/edumagalhaes/quality-prediction-in-a-mining-process">Kaggle</a>.
For this project I used Python code in a program called DeepNote. I had to install Pandas in order to manipulate the data and install Seaborn and Matplotlib in order to visualize the data.
When downloading the mining data for this project, there were commas where decimals should be so I used this code to fix that: <br>
```python
df = pd.read_csv('MiningProcess_Flotation_Plant_Database.csv',decimal=",")
```

## Analysis

I answered **4** questions related to professional basketball:

### 1. You can have sections and text.

Just like this. And you can even add internal coding blocks

```python
print('this is the python code I used to solve this problem')
```
