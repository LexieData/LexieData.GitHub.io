# Metals R' Us: A Mining Analysis Using Python

## Introduction


What I learned from this project was:
  1. You can see summary statistics in Python by coding **df.describe()**
  2. 


## The Data
The data from this project comes from a <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2022_totals.html">website</a> called "Basketball Reference." On there, they have NBA player stats. The data I used comes from **2022**. This data set contains 812 rows and 31 columns, where each row represents a player and the columns contain information like position, team name, player name, and stats like 3 point percentage. I used Tableau to create visualizations using this data.

## Analysis

I answered **4** questions related to professional basketball:

### 1. You can have sections and text.

Just like this. And you can even add internal coding blocks

```python
print('this is the python code I used to solve this problem')
```
