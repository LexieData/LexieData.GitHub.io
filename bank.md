# A Rich Topic You Can Truly Bank On

## Introduction
This is my first project using SQL or Structered Query Language. I used SQL to analyze data from the IDA or International Development Association. IDA is a part of the World Bank Group that provides concessional financing, grants, and policy advice to the poorest countries in the world. 

There were 6 queries I answered:
  1. Show all transactions from Nicaragua.
  2. How many total transactions?
  3. How many total transactions per country?
  4. What is the max owed to the IDA?
  5. Which was the most recent pay?
  6. Who has the most loans?

## The Data
To practice SQL, I used <a href="CSVFiddle.io">CSVFiddle.io</a> which is a website used to practice SQL queries. 

Be sure to follow *The Interesting Project Template* as shown in [**The Data Science Project Studio**](https://www.datacareerjumpstart.com/products/the-data-science-project-studio/categories/2150357707/posts/2158441592). 

### 1. You can have sections and text.

Just like this. And you can even add internal coding blocks

```python
print('this is the python code I used to solve this problem')
```

### 2. You can add any images you'd like.
