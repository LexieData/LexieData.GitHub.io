# Medicare A and B Testing

According to the medicare.gov website, Medicare is described as "federal health insurance for anyone age 65 and older, 
and some people under 65 with certain disabilities or conditions." 
I have had years of experience with the 65 and older crowd working as a eldercare music therapist. I have seen patients 
in skilled nursing, memory care, hospice, home health, adult day center, assisted living, and even independent living facilties. I've learned that not all 
of these facilities operate the same behind the scenes, especially when it comes to insurance coverage.

By using open-sourced Medicare data, I learned:
  1. 
  2. 
  3.


## The Data
I found two data sets from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services website at this <a href="https://data.cms.gov/summary-statistics-on-use-and-payments/medicare-medicaid-service-type-reports/cms-program-statistics-medicare-part-d">link</a for Medicare Part D and 
this<a href="https://data.cms.gov/summary-statistics-on-use-and-payments/medicare-medicaid-service-type-reports/cms-program-statistics-medicare-part-a-part-b-all-types-of-service">link</a for Medicare A and B. 

For context, there are four parts to Medicare:
  Part A: Hospital Insurance
  Part B: Medical Insurance
  Part C: Medicare Advantage
  Part D: Drug Insurance

Part A helps to cover inpatient hospital visits, skilled nursing, home health, and hospice care. 
Part B helps to cover services from doctors/other health providers, home health, outpatient care, durable equipment, and preventative services.
Part C is provided by a private Medicare-approved company and offers a package deal with combining Parts A, B, and D.
Part D helps to cover prescription drugs. 

In creating this project, I wanted to do a deep dive into the different parts of Medicare and answer the following questions:
  1. Which Part is used more often?
  2. How do premiums compare between Part A and Part B?
  3. How much of Medicare is actually used and what in price bracket?

### 1. You can have sections and text.

Just like this. And you can even add internal coding blocks

```python
print('this is the python code I used to solve this problem')
```

### 2. You can add any images you'd like.
