## Massachusetts Education Analysis

<img src="images/Massachusetts Education Overview.png"/>

When I started public high school, the school was brand new. Only two grades, Freshmen and Sophomore. Everyone was figuring out the ins and outs of learning or teaching in this brand new school. Class sizes were smaller with not a lot of diversity. My experience was very different than the well established high schools that had history and traditions. The data set I analyzed for this project doesn't show how old each school is, but I learned other factors.

For this project, the goal was to answer three questions for the Massachusetts superintendent: <br>
  1. Which schools are struggling the most? <br>
  2. How does class size effect college admission?<br>
  3. What are the top math schools in the state?

### The Data
This data set comes from the Massachusetts Department of Education and was last updated in 2017. I gleaned insights from 1,862 rows of data which translates to 1,862 schools and cleaned the data by removing any duplicates. 
You can find the data set <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ndalziel/massachusetts-public-schools-data?select=MA_Public_Schools_datadict.csv">here</a>. <br>
Then I uploaded the data into Tableau in order to visualize the data. I created a bar chart, scatter plot, and line graph which can be found at my dashboard <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lexie.langella/viz/TableauMASchools/Dashboard1">here</a>

From this I learned:
  - Only 10 schools acheived 100% graduation rate
  - The higher the class size, the more likely those students graduate and attend college
  - 4 schools met the passing threshold for math scores for the 4th grade

### Analysis
Out of 1,862 schools, the schools shown below have the lowest graduation percentage. They all have lower than 20% graduation rate.

The Curtis-Tufts High School is an alternative school that teaches special needs students. They provide smaller class sizes and a more individualized education program. They have a 0% graduation rate since any graduating students receive a Medford High School diploma. <br>
Below are the top 10 schools with 100% graduation rate.

The scatter plot shows the percent of students who attended college based on class size. The majority of schools had between 10 and 20 students in their class. There are outliers in both directions where some schools had fewer than 10 in class some had more than 20. The trend line indicates that the more students you have in class, the more likely it is that students will graduate and go to college.

The darker the dots are on this scatter plot, the more economically disadvantaged the students are in that class. There are more darker dots below the trend line and especially with lower class size numbers. If class size is a factor in a student not going to college, then adding more students in a class could give more opportunties for students to be motivated by their peers to go to college if they so choose.

Math scores are an indication on a school's success rate. By looking at math scores from the 4th grade,
